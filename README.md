# Chat-Application
It's harder and harder to find people with common interests, especially now with the pandemic. With Chat Whiz you can chat with people anonymously based on interests you select!!

To run this app build it yourself or use the live demo you need atleast 2 people(or 2 open tabs) with common intrests for this to work
Live Demo : https://chat-whiz.herokuapp.com/

run it locally using 
```npm install```
```node server.js```
and now open your brwoser and go to the address "localhost:5000" or the port that your cmputer selects
