# Chat-Application
It's harder and harder to find people with common interests, especially now with the pandemic. With Chat Whiz you can chat with people anonymously based on interests you select!!

For a live demo, you need atleast 2 people(or 2 open tabs) with common interests for this to work. Involve your friends or family, 
Live Demo : https://chat-whiz.herokuapp.com/

Type your interests, and enter them by clicking submit.

Press Connect to connect with someone.

Wait till the website can find someone with similar interests. In case of multiple matching, it will match you with the highest matching individual.
